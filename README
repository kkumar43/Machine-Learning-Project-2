Project Overview:  
In this part, you are required to implement the k-means algorithm and apply your implementation on the given dataset, 
which contains a set of 2-D points. You are required to implement two different strategies for choosing the initial 
cluster centers.

Strategy 1: randomly pick the initial centers from the given samples.

Strategy 2: pick the first center randomly; for the i-th center (i>1), choose a sample (among all possible samples) 
            such that the average distance of this chosen one to all previous (i-1) centers is maximal.

You need to test your implementation on the given data, with the number k of clusters ranging from 2-10. Plot the 
objective function value vs. the number of clusters k. Under each strategy, plot the objective function twice, 
each start from a different initialization.

Workspace: 
Any Python programming environment.

Software: 
Python environment.

Language(s): 
Python. (MATLAB is equally fine, if you have access to it.)

Required Tasks: 
1.    Write code to implement the k-means algorithm with Strategy 1.

2.    Use your code to do clustering on the given data; compute the objective function as a function of k (k = 2, 3, …, 10).

3.    Repeat the above step with another initialization.

4.    Write code to implement the k-means algorithm with Strategy 2.

5.    Use your code to do clustering on the given data; compute the objective function as a function of k (k = 2, 3, …, 10).

6.    Repeat the above step with another initialization.

7.    Submit a short report summarizing the results, including the plots for the objective function values under different settings described above.
